# portfolio-sample-resume-services-website
This is a website I created for a client's resume writing service.
This website was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, JavaScript, and PHP.

// Update 4/18/20
I was unsatisfied with some aspects of the original website and made several changes:

Converted plain divs to semantic HTML5 elements.
Fixed offset.
Improved color scheme and added gradients.
Changed and added more fonts.
Improved 'about' section by adding photos and buttons, split some of the text into columns.
Added cards to 'expertise' section for more visual interest and modern appearance.
Added background image to 'testimonials' section.
Expanded media queries to include more devices.
